Tool takes an input PNG or JPEG which is assumed to be a "filmstrip" style sprite sheet consisting of many equal-width frames in a single row. The tool then splits this single row up into multiple rows.

To build:
	make

To build for debugging:
	make DEBUG=1

Usage:
	./badpng infile.png outfile.png [outrows] [incols] [framewidth] [fillcolor]

The "outrows" argument indicates how many rows the output is to be split into. If this is absent or 0, it is assumed to be 2. The "incols" argument indicates how many frames are present in the input file; this is only necessary if there are an odd number of frames.
