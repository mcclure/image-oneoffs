Tool takes an input PNG or JPEG which is assumed to be a "filmstrip" style sprite sheet consisting of many equal-width frames in a single row. The tool then splits this single row up into multiple rows.

To build:
	make

To build for debugging:
	make DEBUG=1

Usage:
	./badpng infile.png outfile.png [outrows] [incols] [framewidth] [fillcolor]

There are several optional arguments:
* `outrows` is the number of rows to split into (if missing or 0, will be assumed 2)
* `incols` indicates how many frames are present in the input file; this is only necessary if there are an odd number of frames. If missing or 0, it will just split evenly down the middle.
* `framewidth` indicates how wide each frame is; this is only necessary if there is blank space at the end (or if there are an odd number of frames it can be used in place of incols). If missing or 0, it will (again) split things evenly down the middle.
* `fillcolor` is an RGBA hex color (like, 0 for transparent black, 000000FF for visible black, FFFFFF00 for transparent white, FFFFFFFF for visible white, 00FF00FF for visible green, etc). If there is blank space at the end (IE if there are an odd number of frames) the blank space will be filled with this color. If missing, transparent black will be assumed.
